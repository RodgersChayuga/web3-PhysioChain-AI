### **Problem Statement**  
Current physiotherapy practices face several challenges:  
1. **Limited Patient Monitoring**: Patients are only monitored during in-person sessions, leading to gaps in care.  
2. **Inconsistent Exercise Adherence**: Patients often fail to perform exercises correctly or consistently at home.  
3. **Manual Progress Tracking**: Physiotherapists rely on manual documentation, which is time-consuming and error-prone.  
4. **Lack of Data-Driven Insights**: Doctors lack access to historical treatment data to optimize care plans.  
5. **Data Privacy Concerns**: Patient data is often stored in centralized systems, raising privacy and security concerns.  
6. **Inefficient Insurance and Payment Processes**: Manual claims processing and payment systems are slow and prone to errors.  

---

### **Solution Overview**  
PhysioChain addresses these challenges through an **integrated platform** that combines **Web3** and **AI technologies**. Key features include:  

#### **1. Web3 Features**  
- **Tokenized Rewards System**: Patients earn tokens ($PHYSIO) for completing exercises correctly and consistently. Tokens can be redeemed for discounts, health products, or converted to fiat.  
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Patients and doctors use DID for secure, privacy-preserving logins.  
- **Smart Contract-Based Treatment Plans**: Treatment plans are stored on-chain as NFTs (ERC-721 or ERC-1155).  
- **Insurance Integration**: Smart contracts automate insurance claims based on verified patient progress.  
- **Gas Optimization**: Use Layer 2 solutions like **Polygon** to reduce transaction costs.  

#### **2. AI Features**  
- **AI-Powered Exercise Validation**: Use **TensorFlow.js** or **MediaPipe** for real-time pose estimation and form correction.  
- **Personalized Exercise Recommendations**: AI analyzes patient progress and suggests adjustments to treatment plans.  
- **Automated Progress Reports**: AI generates detailed reports for physiotherapists, including adherence rates and improvement trends.  
- **Voice & Chat Assistance**: Integrate a voice-enabled AI assistant (e.g., OpenAI Whisper and GPT) to guide patients through exercises.  

#### **3. Data Privacy and Security**  
- **Patient-Controlled Data Access**: Patients grant temporary access to their records for specific doctors. Access is logged on the blockchain for transparency.  
- **Anonymized Historical Data**: Doctors can access anonymized treatment history for data-driven insights.  
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Patient data is encrypted using **AES-256** or **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**.

### **Access Control and Data Privacy**  

#### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
PhysioChain implements a **role-based access control system** to ensure that patient data is only accessible to authorized individuals.  

- **When a Doctor is Attending to a Specific Patient**:  
  - The doctor will have **temporary access** to the patientâ€™s **historical records** through the app and dashboard.  
  - Access is granted via **smart contracts** and is logged on the blockchain for transparency.  
  - The doctor can view:  
    - Past treatment plans.  
    - Exercise adherence rates.  
    - Progress reports (e.g., form improvement, pain levels, recovery trends).  
    - AI-generated insights and recommendations.  

- **When a Doctor is Not Attending to a Specific Patient**:  
  - Doctors can only access **anonymized historical records** for research and data-driven insights.  
  - Anonymized data includes:  
    - Aggregated adherence rates.  
    - Common treatment patterns.  
    - Recovery trends across different demographics.  

#### **2. Patient-Controlled Data Access**  
- Patients have **full control** over who accesses their data.  
- They can grant or revoke access to specific doctors or therapists through the app.  
- Access permissions are enforced via **smart contracts** and are time-bound (e.g., access expires after a set period).  

#### **3. Blockchain-Based Transparency**  
- All access requests and grants are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring **immutable and transparent logs**.  
- Patients can review who accessed their data and when through their app dashboard.  

#### **4. Data Encryption and Security**  
- Patient data is **encrypted** using **AES-256** or **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**.  
- Historical records are stored on **decentralized storage systems** like **IPFS** or **Arweave**, ensuring security and redundancy.
